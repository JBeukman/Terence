                  <p>I started in the financial services industry over 15 years ago and became a financial planner and
                    investment advisor 10 years ago. My passion is to ensure that I assist clients in creating financial
                    plans to meet their financial objectives through savings & investments, tax reduction and personal
                    protection plans within their affordability. This is to ensure that they reach financial wellness.

                    As each client is a unique individual with their own desires, needs and goals, I offer a multi-step
                    financial planning process that is based on an international six-step process (often with a few
                    extra steps). This is undertaken over a period of time and in line with ever-changing budgetary and
                    family requirements of my clients.

                    I take great pride in offering holistic independent financial planning services, educating clients
                    through the decision-making process and allowing them to make the ultimate decision without being
                    pressured into products/services that you do not need or cannot afford. There are no high
                    commissions, no hidden costs and I also make use of a fee model, to ensure that you never feel
                    pressured into product sales. Sadly this is the norm in our profession.

                    Before I ever get to recommending products, I do a thorough fact find to ensure that I understand
                    your individual circumstances and needs, as well as your objectives and aspirations for the future.
                    Whether planning for retirement or passing wealth onto future generations, as I am not tied to any
                    product provider, I provide solutions that are best of the market for my client’s needs.

                    One hour spent with me is worth tens of thousands of rands over the long term.</p>

                  <p>Lending as an asset class is not new, it is available to institutions and obviously the banks. We
                    are used to being the borrower, for buying a car, a home, perhaps funding a short term loan. This
                    asset class is now available to all investors (lenders). Sectional Title Body Corporates (Community
                    Schemes) are unique borrowers, as they legislatively cannot go bankrupt, members (residents) are
                    legally obligated to pay levies and Sectional Title Body Corporates cannot lend from a bank – would
                    you sign personal surety for your neighbour? That is where we offer a solution, in the 4 different
                    life stage products with a Hollard Capital Guarantee on one of them and legislative protection for
                    lenders and borrowers in this space. Since the Sectional Title’s Act came into effect and was first
                    tested in court in 2001 (The Amine Case) – no lender has suffered a loss. What financial service
                    provider can give proof and backed up data to show over 18 years of no losses – ever!</p>

                <div class="py-3">
                  <p>The return is not expected but rather a pre-determend contractual rate. If the loan is voted in,
                    the body corporates and those residents are charged prime plus a factor as well as a raising fee and
                    admin fee. Exactly the same as when we apply from the banks for a home loan. We get a rate linked to
                    prime, pay a raising (or activation fee in thousands) and a monthly admin fee for the bond. (The
                    body corporate can alternatively be charged a flat monthly fee in line with the Ombuds
                    recommendations that covers these three costs.) I must stress that each resident in the body
                    corporate is not forced to partake in the loan.

                    Also note that a loan will only be granted after a full due diligence process of the body corporate
                    is followed and a majority vote at an AGM or SGM.</p>

                <div class="py-3">
                  <p>I need to break my answer up into a few parts:

                    To assist with aligning our thoughts with Sectional Titles legislation, I have included the “EY
                    Stuart legal opinion” (endorsed by Webber Wentzel) as it is quite user-friendly:

                    Part A. 1.h. – Perpetual Succession

                    Part A. 2 – Every unit owner automatically a member

                    Part A 3.1 – Cannot be destroyed

                    Part A 3.2 – Cannot be placed in liquidation

                    Firstly, making reference to the Part A points above, we can understand that a Sectional Title Body
                    Corporate (BC) cannot die, cannot be destroyed or go insolvent. I.e. it has to continue and it has
                    to seek financial assistance where cash flow issues exist (arrear levies) or where the Body
                    Corporate does not want burden its members with a potential large special levy (special projects).

                    Part B 10 – Creditors stand first ranking

                    Secondly, we also understand that creditors (our clients), regardless of whether they are
                    individuals, corporates or trusts stand first ranking with respect to the recovery of capital. This
                    point is key to the long-standing security afforded to our clients. (This point in various versions
                    has been tested right up to the Appellate division of the Supreme Court on 4x separate occasions,
                    where the creditor has been protected.)

                    Another critical point that often gets overlooked is the due diligence process in vetting the
                    borrowers. In summary, it’s extensive and the conditions of loans are strict. Furthermore, no more
                    than 20% of the developments municipal valuation will ever be made available to a Body Corporate.
                    I.e. technically a loan would have to go beyond 500% interest before the point below would be
                    considered.

                    Part C. 1. – All unit holders can be joined

                    Thirdly, this is an extension of the point above in that if recovery cannot be secured directly
                    through the arrear levy units, the balance of the community can be held jointly liable in their PQ
                    (participation quota) share. I’m not aware of any cases where this element of the legislation has
                    been implemented as the point above has to date always been successful. I.e. this provision is a
                    back-up plan.

                    Having considered pertinent points that are material to the questions, let’s consider the questions:

                    “but are there any scenarios where losses could happen”

                    As we know, there haven’t been any circumstances where loss has occurred. This also as a result of
                    the continued examination of potential threats to our clients capital in our

                    environment. In the past 3 odd years, two legal items have raised their heads and have been dealt
                    with:

                    Prescription - debts extinguish after three years from the date when it became payable if the debtor
                    is not commutated with regarding the debt. Thus, if BCFS did not provide the Body Corporate with
                    correspondence regarding the outstanding debt, this would be a threat. BCFS have always communicated
                    monthly. Furthermore, loan agreements with BC’s have all been updated to further negate this
                    possibility.

                    In Duplum - Literally translated, in duplum means 'double the amount'. This is not a capital threat
                    but rather the limiting of interest to 100%. This, (and Prescription) applies to all loans. Consider
                    this scenario… Every 20-year housing loan will have a greater than 100% interest implication. How is
                    this overcome? In Duplum is constantly ‘delayed’ when payments are made by the debtor. i.e. every
                    bond payment delays the In Duplum. The same is true on BCFS loans. A condition of loan is small
                    regular payments which delay In Duplum. To this end, all loan agreements with Body Corporates were
                    updated in 2016 & 2017, making provision for mandatory payments, thereby removing this threat.

                    It was also estimated that these two items could potentially affect only around 1% of older loans on
                    the book, yet BCFS still took the necessary actions to protect client capital.

                    …and what would the process be if the body corporate cannot continue to repay its debt?

                    When a loan becomes due and payable as per the terms of the loan, the Body Corporate will have the
                    option:

                    Take a further loan, assuming all due diligence criteria is still met, or

                    Take action against those units with unpaid levies:

                    During the loan, BCFS’s legal department and / the BC’s lawyers will have taken the necessary steps
                    to action court proceedings:

                    A Sale in Execution (SIE) is issued. At this point, the arrear levy contributions often magically
                    appear. Movable items can be attached. The property is attached and will most likely be auctioned.
                    Here we have personally witnessed auctioneers making buyers aware of the obligation to add any
                    arrear levies to the bidding price to settle creditors (creditors are first ranking). Creditors have
                    to be settled before a clearance certificate can be issued. Once all creditors are settled, the
                    property can be transferred (Banks and SARS engage here). Note, all unitholders can still be held
                    jointly liable if necessary as well</p>

                aria-controls="pb_faq4" class="pb_font-22 py-4">could you tell me about the profile of investor that you
                would feel this investment is suited for? What investments should they already have and how could this
                be structured into their portfolio?</a>
              <div id="pb_faq4" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                <div class="py-3">
                  <p>you have raised a very important point, the entire process end to end is handled by the skilled
                    team of highly qualified individuals at BCFS, some of whom even consult to parliament and have
                    written sections of the legislation. You would never have to get your hands involved with
                    collections or anything, BCFS handle it all. I feel this is an asset class in its own right.

                    This should form part of every investor’s portfolio, after a careful planning process, risk
                    analysis, tax analysis, and cash flow analysis has been concluded. What this product does cater to
                    is all life stages of investors. So you have some paying a monthly contribution to building capital,
                    you have others with capital who want security, stability and certainty to grow it further and
                    lastly, you have those retiring or in retirement battling to make their funds cover their expenses,
                    we can do that at around double what is available traditionally. As this is a cautious profiled
                    solution, I feel it caters for all investors (repeating myself but it is important).

                  <p>Body Corporate Funding Solutions (BCFS), have four different plans to meet clients’ needs and to
                    match life stages.

                    For those lenders who want to start with a monthly recurring contribution, the solution would be the
                    POWERED WEALTH product. This product has 60 months contribution requirement (Contribution, not
                    repayment), starting at R1000 per month and has zero or 10% annual escalation. Prime + 5% per annum
                    rate. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.

                    If you are a lender with capital to deploy, then there is the FORTIFIED CAPITAL PLUS product, which
                    has a minimum requirement of just R50 000. (Repayment profile is an average of 3-5 years at Prime +
                    5% per annum). Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.

                    Many retirees or those requiring income on a monthly basis, make use of the INCOME ENERGISER product
                    which earns them a Prime + 3% rate. Interest is calculated daily and paid out monthly for income.
                    Important to note that income will vary slightly per month, as it is calculated on the number of
                    days in the month; IE: February 28 days, March 31 days and April 30 days. However, this is very easy
                    to calculate.

                    Lastly, for those who want an extra layer of protection, BCFS have an insured product offering from
                    Hollard, called the INSURED CAPITAL product which requires an initial deposit of R250 000 at Prime +
                    3% per annum. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.

                    I have a fantastic excel calculator which illustrates all the above in an easy to read table and
                    provides certainty on what to expect on a month to month basis.

                    In closing, what is vital to note, is that there are no fees on the above as the Body Corporate
                    cover those. The rates above further enhanced by compound interest, therefore the effective rate is
                    about 1.2% higher.</p>

                certain period of time and what happens when a Body Corporate repays their loan faster than

                  <p>The good news is that although 60 payments are required on the monthly plan via debit order, should
                    an investor be unable to continue for whatever reason, they may stop contributions and are
                    encouraged to resume when they can. What would happen during this period is that rate would drop to
                    prime + 1% until they resume normal payments, then it would go back to prime + 5%.

                    Body Corporates do repay their loans early and this is encouraged and without fee or penalty to
                    them. When that happens, the funds pass from the Body Corporate to Cash Custodian (SANNE) and
                    straight back to the client. I have had this happen to many clients, long before the 60-month period
                    is up.</p>

                  <p>You are correct, a special levy is an option. One of the snags of a special levy is it could take
                    months if not years to build up the capital required for a project unless this special levy is a
                    large lump sum. Now if the resident doesn’t have the lump sum to pay in, they need to fund it
                    somehow. This could be from a personal loan, credit card, increases on their overdrafts or even
                    increasing their home loan (their bond). Should they opt not to use these lending options from banks
                    (traditionally) with some interest rates being Prime + 15%, they can make use of a lending facility
                    via Body Corporate Funding Solutions (BCFS) which is how we as lenders get Prime + 5% (upper limit)
                    for the lender, not the borrower. There is actually no maximum but BCFS adheres to the maximum that
                    the NCA recommends. There are many complexes that have special projects, such as solar
                    installations. These complexes do have the means to service a loan and do not need the funds for
                    arrear levies. This type of lending is at Prime + 3% via an amortised loan. All body corporates are
                    encouraged and without fee or penalty to repay their loans as quickly as possible – to ensure
                    responsible lending principles are applied. It is important to note that no one in the complex is
                    forced to partake in this lending environment. If they have the money for the special levy, they
                    simply pay it in and their participation is zero.</p>
